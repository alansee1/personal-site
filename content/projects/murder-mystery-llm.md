## Overview

An interactive SQL learning game where players solve a mystery by querying a database, assisted by an AI helper named Watson. Unlike the original SQL Murder Mystery, this version features an LLM that reviews queries, catches errors, suggests best practices, and provides hints - all with detective/Watson character flavor.
